# COVID-19 Data Exploration/Analysis

## Project Overview

This project utilizes SQL to perform a detailed analysis of COVID-19 data, aiming to extract meaningful insights on case and death rates, as well as vaccination efforts across various locations. Through a series of SQL queries and data manipulation techniques such as joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, and aggregate functions, this project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis that contributes to a better understanding of the pandemic's impact.

### Features

#### Data Extraction: 
Use basic and complex SQL queries to fetch relevant COVID-19 data.

#### Analytical Insights: 
Calculate key metrics such as death percentages, infection rates compared to population, and vaccination percentages.

#### SQL Techniques: 
Uses joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, and views to manage and analyze data.




### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

To run these SQL scripts, you will need:

Access to a SQL Server environment where you can execute the scripts.

A copy of the COVID-19 data in a SQL database. Ensure your database schema matches the schema used in the scripts (CovidProject..CovidDeaths, CovidProject..CovidVaccinations).

### Setup

Ensure that your SQL environment is properly set up and that you have the necessary permissions to create tables and views.

Import the COVID-19 data into your database according to the schema specified in the SQL scripts.

### Running the Scripts

Execute the SQL scripts in your SQL environment.

You can either run the entire script at once or execute it section by section to observe different analyses.
